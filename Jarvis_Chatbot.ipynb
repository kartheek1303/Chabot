            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[a] Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.[b]\n",
            "\n",
            "AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[citation needed] As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.\n",
            "\n",
            "Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[7] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"),[8][9] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[7] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[11]\n",
            "\n",
            "The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[c] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.[12] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques—including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\n",
            "\n",
            "The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[d] This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. Science fiction and futurology have also suggested that, with its enormous potential and power, AI may become an existential risk to humanity.\n",

These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.\n",
            "\n",
            "The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Church-Turing thesis, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[21] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\".\n",
            "\n",
            "When access to digital computers became possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to step-by-step symbol manipulation, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI. Approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background.\n",
            "\n",
            "The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[e][25] The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research.[f] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[g] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[h][27] By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[28] and laboratories had been established around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[31] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[32]\n",

            "They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult. [8]\n",
            "\n",
            "In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[34] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[7] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[9]\n",
            "\n",
            "Many researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems. Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.[i] Interest in neural networks and \"connectionism\" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.[40] Soft computing tools were developed in the 80s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization.\n",
            "\n",
            "AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems. The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[41] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".[11]\n",

            "Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012. According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.[j] He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had \"incorporated AI in some offerings or processes\".[43] The amount of research into AI (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.\n",

            "Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning. This concern has led to the subfield artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[12]\n",

The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows.

Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\".[69] In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones.

The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\").

These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.[98] Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.[99] Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms.

These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made.

The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all. Human information processing is easy to explain, however human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.\n",

In some cases, this assumption may be unfair.[205] An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. ProPublica claims that the COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be an overestimate than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.

optimization\\n\\nMany problems in AI can be solved theoretically by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:[91] Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search.', 'For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.', '[92] Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.', '[93] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in

numbers.', 'The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.', 'The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps.', 'In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\").', 'Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.', '[96] Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.', 'A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization.', 'For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made.', 'These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top.', 'Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.', '[98] Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search.', 'For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses).', 'Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.', '[99] Alternatively, distributed

completely true or false.', '[106] Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.', '[55] Several

random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.', 'Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information.', 'AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.', '[107] Bayesian networks[108] are a very general tool that can be used for various problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[n][110] learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[o][112] planning (using decision networks)[113] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).', '[114] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering,

then diamond\") and controllers (\"if diamond then pick up\").', 'Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems.', 'Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match.', 'They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI.', 'These examples are known as observations or patterns.', 'In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class.', 'A class is a decision that has to be made.', 'All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set.', 'When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.', '[119]\\n\\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches.', 'The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.', '[120] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s.', '[121] Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.', '[122] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.', '[124] Neural networks are also used for classification.', '[125]\\n\\nClassifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, the dimensionality, and the level of noise.', 'Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data.', 'Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.', '[126]\\n\\nArtificial neural networks\\n\\nA neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain\\n\\nNeural networks[125] were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain.', 'A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), casts a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate.', 'Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another.', 'Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.', 'Modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or and find patterns in data.', 'They can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations.', 'Neural networks can be viewed a type of mathematical optimization — they perform a gradient descent on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network.', 'The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.', '[127] Other learning techniques for neural networks are Hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), GMDH or competitive learning.', '[128]\\n\\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events).', 'Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.', \"[129]\\n\\nDeep learning\\n\\nRepresenting Images on Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Deep Learning\\n\\nDeep learning[131] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs.\", 'The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.', 'For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.', 'Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others.', 'Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers.', \"In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron's receptive field.\", 'This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons, and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.', 'In a recurrent neural network the signal will propagate through a layer more than once;[136] thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.', 'RNNs can be trained by gradient descent,[138] however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can \"vanish\" (that is, they can tend to zero) or \"explode\" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.', '[139] The long short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.', '[140]\\n\\nSpecialized languages and hardware\\n\\nSpecialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed, such as Lisp, Prolog, TensorFlow and many others.', 'Hardware
